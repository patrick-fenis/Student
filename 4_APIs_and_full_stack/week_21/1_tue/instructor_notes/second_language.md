# Learning Your Second Language
-------

## What you will learn
- Creating Variables in a New Language
- Conditionals in a New Language
- Looping in a New Language
- Collections in a New Language
- Writing Functions in a New Language
-------

## Getting Started

In the directory you normally take notes, touch a `notes.py` file and open with using VS Code's `code .` command.

## Creating Variables

How we did it in Javascript
```js
// We create constant variables with the const keyword
const myConstant = 5
// We create re-assignable variables with the let keyword
let myVariable = "Hello World"

// We Printed Variables to the console using console.log
console.log(myConstant)
console.log(myVariable)
```

How we do this in Python
```python
# Constants don't exist in python, but convention is to name constants in all CAPS
MY_CONSTANT = 5
# All variable by default are re-assignable, snake case is the norm in python
my_variable = "Hello World"

# We print variables to the console with the print function
print(MY_CONSTANT)
print(my_variable)
```

### Receiving Input

In Javascript we could either use forms, prompt to receive input from the user on the frontend. In node, getting input from the console is a bit more complicated, let's see how we would do that in nodeJS.

```js
// Import Readline Node Library and Create Interface to Read Input
const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});
 
// Ask questions, receive input, run callback in response
readline.question('Who are you?', name => {
  console.log(`Hey there ${name}!`);
  readline.close();
});
```

How would we do that in Python?
```python
# Input function asks the questions and returns input
user_input = input("Who are You?")

# We can interpolate the variable into this print
print(f"Hey there {user_input}")
```

## Conditionals

If statements in Javascript
```js
const num = 5

if (num > 3){
    console.log("num is greater than 3")
} else if (num > 1){
    console.log("num is greater than 1")
} else {
    console.log("num is 1 or less")
}
```

If statements in Python
```python
num = 5

# The indentation is required in python
if (num > 3):
    print("num is greater than 3")
elif (num > 1):
    print("num is greater than 1")
else:
    print("num is 1 or less")
```

## While Loops

In Javascript
```js
let counter = 0

//This will loop 10 times
while(counter < 10){
    console.log(counter)
    counter += 1
}
```

In Python
```python
counter = 0

#this will loop 10 times
while (counter < 10):
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```

## 10 Minute Exercise

Write the code to do the following:
- Loop 10 times starting the counter at 0
- On each loop if the counter is even print "it's even"
- If odd, print "meow" if the number is divisble by 3
- Otherwise print nothing

## Collections

In Javascript we have arrays and objects
```js
const myArray = [1,2,3]

console.log(myArray) //logging the entire array
console.log(myArray[0]) // logging an individual item

const myObject = {
    cheese: "gouda",
    bread: "rye"
}

console.log(myObject) //logging the entire object
console.log(myObject.cheese) // logging a property using dot notation
console.log(myObject["bread"]) // logging a property using square bracket notation
```

In python we have lists and dictionaries
```python

my_list = [1,2,3]
print(my_list) # Printing the whole list
print(my_list[0]) # Printing an individual item

my_dictionary = {"cheese": "gouda", "bread":"rye"}
print(my_dictionary) #Printing the whole dictionary
print(my_dictionary["cheese"]) #accessing one value from the dictionary

```

## 10 Minute Exercise

Google Python List Methods/Functions and discover the following and apply them to the following list.

```py
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

- How to find a lists length
- How to loop over a list
- How to add and remove items from a list

## Functions 

in Javascript
```js

const addNums = (x, y) => {
    return x + y
}

console.log(addNums(5,5))
```

In python
```python

def add_nums (x,y):
    return x + y

print(add_nums(5,5))

```

## 10 minute exercise
Write the following functions

 - sub_nums that takes two arguments and returns their difference
 - say_hello that takes a name as an arguments and says hello to that name
 - say_hello_adv that takes a dictionary with a name and age property and prints "hello {name}, how does it feel to be {age} years old"
 - looper takes one array as an argument, it loops over the array and prints each item individually
