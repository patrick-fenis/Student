# CSS Games 

Happy Thursday! You'll get to take it relatively easy this afternoon and play a few games -- CSS practice games, of course!

### [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

The point of the game is to move the frog(s) (the element) onto the lily pads using flexbox properties. 

### [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/)

The point of the game is to use flexbox to position towers to defend against enemies from getting past your defense!

### [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)

The point of the game is to select the correct HTML elements in CSS.

This resource from [w3schools](http://webdevable.com/w3schools/css/exercisef5ec.html?filename=exercise_syntax1) is a great space to practice quick CSS reps when you've got a few minutes to spare!
