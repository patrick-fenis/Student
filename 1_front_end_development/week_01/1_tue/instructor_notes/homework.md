# Homework

Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you
how you want to plan your time for a given exercise. That said, **we expect
homework to take around four hours for most assignments.**

**Turn in something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely**
better than turning in nothing at all. We can't get you the help you need unless
we see what you're working on. That said, **unexcused late homework will not be
accepted**. If you have issues submitting homework please let us know.

**Each assignment will ask you to learn or research something that has
explicitly not been covered in class.** Learning how to learn is fundamental to
becoming a successful developer.

## Due Dates and Grading

You will generally be assigned homework every Wednesday and Saturday and homework is due the **following week that SAME day before class starts.**

So if an exercise is assigned on Wednesday, it is due the next week on Wednesday before the start of class at 6:30 pm ET. If an exercise is assigned on Saturday, it is due the next Saturday before class starts at 10:00 am ET.

Each assignment contains instructions on how to submit it. Generally, you will
fork and clone the repository and make your submission with a pull request.

**Plagiarized homework will not be accepted.** Concerned about what is
considered plagiarism? Consult an instructor.

In order to receive a "Complete" grade on an assignment, your submission must
contain **functional** code that goes towards solving the assignment prompt.

If you are unable to provide any code that goes towards solving the assignment
prompt, you should, at the least, provide the following:

- Provide a pseudocode solution of how you would logically approach the prompt
- Indicate what specific concepts and tasks you are struggling with
- Include specific questions you would like an instructor to answer
- Indicate at least two resources you have found via Google that you think could
  be useful towards addressing the prompt

You will still receive an "Incomplete" for this submission, which counts for 0%
of the assignment. However, it's very much to your advantage to get this done at
a minimum so instructors can address your concerns before the unit continues and
keep you from falling behind.

If you do not turn in an assignment by the due date or don't meet the requisites
for an "Incomplete," it will be marked as "Missing." A missing counts for 0% of
the assignment.

If you would like to make up an assignment marked as "Incomplete", you may do so
by turning it in late, as long as you have it submitted by the end of the current unit. **When you resubmit, please notify your IA's so they know to review your new submission**

Missing assignments, so always turn something in!

While this policy may seem strict, it is very much designed for your benefit. In
the past, we've experimented with more relaxed submission policies and students
end up in a situation where they haven't submitted enough homework to graduate
and there isn't enough time to make up missing assignments.

## What to include with your submission

On **every submission** -- that is, on every pull request (or, sometimes, issue)
-- please include:

- **Comfort score**, out of 5
- **Completeness score**, out of 5

**Feedback will not be given on assignments by an instructor or TA unless you
specifically request it.** Requests for feedback, however, are highly
encouraged. In order to get feedback on your assignment, when submitting your
pull request or issue, please ask specific questions, **ending them with a
question mark**. We receive _lots_ of assignments, and we rely on questions
marks to provide a visual cue that we should stop and address something! Be sure
to point us to the lines of code where you encountered issues and what you've
already tried to solve your problems.

For example:

> Any thoughts as to why the function on line 49 kept returning 'NaN'? I Googled
> the error and found that I need to convert my inputs to integers but I'm not
> sure where to apply the method.

## The Submission Process

All homework assignments will have their own Github repository with specific
instructions on how to submit your assignment. You will need to fork the homework and then clone your forked version to work in. When you're done, you will push your changes to your forked version and open a pull request on the classroom version. Almost none of that probably makes sense to you on day one but by the time you're working on homework, it will so keep this handy for when that time comes. If you run in to errors or any hiccups with this process
start by researching the issue. If you're still stuck after 20 minutes, ask an instructor for help!
