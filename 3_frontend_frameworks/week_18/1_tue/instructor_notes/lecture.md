# Group Git

### Objectives
*After this lesson students will be able to*
- Describe the different steps of the git workflow process
- Explain basic git commands in terms of this model, e.g., commit, add, log
- Safely work on a feature branch and merge it back to the master branch
- Be aware of 2 pitfalls when working with git in a Group and how to resolve/avoid them.


### The Git Workflow

![Basic Commands](https://i.imgur.com/blN6xuD.png)

Layer| Description
---- | ----
Working Directory | Local file system (your computer's files like normal)
Staging Area | Changes that have been `add`ed and are ready to commit
History | Changes that have been committed in a series of commits uniquely identified by a `SHA1` hash
Remote | An associated version of the repository on a remote host accessible via networking


The first three layers are ones we've seen before.  The working directory is the normal files on your machine; the staging area are files that will be included in the next commit; history denotes all committed changes.

We've also been working with `remote`s when cloning/pushing from github.


### Git Command Review

Now let's go over some `git` commands used in the workflow.  Each command will typically either be used to inspect the changes at a particular layer(s) or it will transition a set of changes from one layer to another.

Command | Function | Data Layer(s)
----- | ----- | -----
add | move changes | WD -> Staging
commit | move changes | Staging -> History
status | inspect changes | WD/Staging/History (via what commit is the last one)
branch | inspect | WD/History (via what branch is current)
log | inspect | History
push | move changes/sync | Local History -> Remote History
pull | move changes/sync | Remote History -> Local History/WD/Current Branch
checkout | move index | WD (moves WD reference to a different HEAD of History)
merge | move changes | applies new changes from one branch to the HEAD of the current branch




Let's look at an example and outline the steps up to committing and pushing to origin:

### Feature Branching + Merging

Conceptually what branching looks like:

This is what is happening under the hood:
![Detailed Branch Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/gpqWlIs.png)

### Main branch - Code Along

Create a new folder called `git-demo` that will not be nested inside an existing git repo

```sh
mkdir git-demo
```

 Initialize this as a new git repo

```sh
git init

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/username/Desktop/seir-526/unit3/lectures-dev/git-lecture-test2/.git/
```


Create a new file called `hello.js`

```sh
touch feature-hello.js
```
Add a function called: `hello`

```js
function hello() { }
```

Git `add and commit` changes.  

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'feature-hello - added hello function'
```

Look at the log files: 
```sh
git log

commit 6f25491daadbd6ecabe0bd9499016be4133abd3b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:10:31 2020 -0400

  feature-hello - added hello function
```

Try using the `git log --oneline` flag

```sh
git log --oneline

6f25491 (HEAD -> master) added hello function
```


Create a new online git repo called `git-demo`
Add a new remote called `origin` to your local repo and use the url from the git repo 

```sh
git remote add origin git/github remote repo url
```

Push to the origin branch to the remote repo

```sh
git push origin master
```

### Feature Branch - Code Along

As a project grows, it can help substantially to break out sets of changes into their own branches which are subsequently merged back into the `master` branch.  As you know, these branches can also be pushed to github.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/o002Fk0.png)

Let's check out a new feature branch 

```sh
 git checkout -b feature-bye

 Switched to a new branch 'feature-bye'
 ```

Confirm the branch exists and is the active branch: git branch

```sh
* feature-bye
  master
```

Create a new file called: `bye.js`

```sh
touch bye.js
```

Add a function called: `bye`

```js
function bye() { }
```

Git `add and commit` changes.  

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'feature-bye - added bye function'
```


Git log and confirm that both commits are there

```sh
❯ git log
commit 065aecf896862a0f8446a6da34106f82cf3018b6 (HEAD -> feature-bye)
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:17:21 2020 -0400

    feature-bye - added bye function

commit 6f25491daadbd6ecabe0bd9499016be4133abd3b (master)
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:10:31 2020 -0400

    feature-hello - added hello function
```

Try using the `git log --oneline` flag

```sh
git log --online 

065aecf (HEAD -> feature-bye) feature-bye - added bye function
6f25491 (master) feature-hello - added hello function
```

Chekcout the master branch and confirm that bye.js file doesn't exist

```sh
 git checkout master
 ```

Git log and confirm that the commit message from the feature-bye branch doesn't exist

```sh
git log

commit 6f25491daadbd6ecabe0bd9499016be4133abd3b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:10:31 2020 -0400

    feature-hello - added hello function
```

Merge the feature-bye branch into master

```sh
git merge feature-bye
```

```sh
Updating 6f25491..065aecf
Fast-forward
 bye.js | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 bye.js
```

Git log and confirm that the feature-bye branch is now included in the logs
```sh
commit 065aecf896862a0f8446a6da34106f82cf3018b6 (HEAD -> master, feature-bye)
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:17:21 2020 -0400

    feature-bye - added bye function

commit 6f25491daadbd6ecabe0bd9499016be4133abd3b
Author: Joe Keohan <jkeohan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 08:10:31 2020 -0400

    feature-hello - added hello function
```

Push the feature-bye branch to the remote repo

```sh
git push origin feature-bye

remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'bye' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/jkeohan/git-testing/pull/new/bye
remote: 
To https://github.com/jkeohan/git-testing.git
 * [new branch]      bye -> bye
```

Since the feature branch has already been merged with maater we should delete the local branch

```sh
git braanch -d feature-bye
```

Let's assume that the team has also downloaded and merged the feature branch we pushed to the remote repo and now delete the remote branch as well. 

```sh
git push origin --delete feature-bye
```

That completes the successful workflow of creating a feature branch and merging to master 


### Conflict Resolution

Feature branches are great but can lead to difficulties
when overlapping or incompatible sets of changes are merged back in to a common branch, e.g., `master`.  `Git` is pretty good about safely handling multiple streams of changes, but sometimes you have to manually pitch in to get the job done.

If you are trying to use `git merge` and it produces a conflict the output will look something like this:

```bash
Auto-merging convo.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in convo.js
Resolved 'convo.js' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

> To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME.
[source](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)

Create a new file called: `stringly.js`

```sh
touch stringly.js
```

Checkout a new branch called `feature-upperCase`
```sh
git checkout -b feaature-upperCase
```


Add a function called `toUpperCase`

```js
function toUpperCase() {}
```

Add and commit the changes

```sh
git add .
git commit -m  'feature-upperCase - added toUpperCase function'
```

```sh
git checkout master
```

Merge feature-upperCase to master

```sh
git merge feature-upperCase
```

Checkout a new branch called `feature-lowerrCase`

```sh
git checkout -b feature-lowerrCase
```

Add a function called `toUpperCase`

```js
function toLowerCase() {}
```

Add and commit the changes

```sh
git add .
git commit -m  'feature-lowerCase - added toLowerCase function'
```


Checkout master

```sh
git checkout master
```


Merge feature-lowerCase with master

```sh
git merge feature-lowerCase
```

You should see a message indicating there has been a conflict and when you examine stringly.js you will see the following:


  ```js
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  function toUpper(str) {
    return str.toUpperCase();
  =======
  function toLower(str) {
    return str.toLowerCase();
  >>>>>>> lower
  }
  ```

Resolve conflict by either removing the utility lines (a rarely available solution but it works in this case), or remove one set of changes.  Either way, whatever the state of the file when we save+quit, that will be what ends up being committed so make sure it's valid!

### Exercise: Local Conflict Resolution
Go [here](local_lab.md) and follow the instructions



## Pull Request And Merging In Github

The instructor will ask the students to fork/clone this repo, if they haven't already done so, and to create a new file caalled: `<student-name>.md` where they will include a random fact about themselves. 

They will add/commit and push to their forked copy of the repo and the instructor will choose a volunteer to share their screen and make a Pull Request.

The instructor will then walk through the process of approving and merging the pull request.

## Bonus:  Rebasing branches

If time permits the instructor willl demo how to rebase branches.


![](https://i.imgur.com/PRPhtu6.png)

[`git rebase`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)

Rebasing rewrites history.  This adds the commits from another branch and puts your commits on top of your branch.  (Actually it puts _new copies_ of your commits on top). Typically, we rebase `master` from another branch.  This does not add an extra merge-commit.

**Ex**: From some branch: `git rebase master` will take anything that was added to master since branched off (or last rebased) and put those commits _before yours_.  Your commits are then added on top of your branch.

Technically, `git pull` is a shorthand for `git fetch origin HEAD` together with `git merge origin/HEAD`.  In other words, `pull` is an alias for fetching the changes from origin and merging them into the local copy of the branch.  adding the `--rebase` flag to `pull` will rebase rather than merge, thereby not adding a merge commit to your history but carrying with it additional pain when conflicts emerge.



## Bonus: Resets (Resources)
`git reset` can be used to undo a committed history and place the changes back either into the staging area `--soft` or in the working directory `--mixed` or discard them entirely `--hard`.  Be very careful with `git reset` especially with the `--hard` option since this is potentially destructive.

If you undo a public history you will have to `git push --force` after making the changes.
